"""TODO: implement variance estimation experiment code!
 
 Run indefinitely, until got exit input:
    1) take in distance
    2) run until collected N samples
    3) put in a csv file for instance, column name is GT distance, rows are measured values
       or just new file per one GT distance and write measurements there, not to fuck up 
       a single file in case of any errors : )
