TODO:
- read on UWB https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=uwb&btnG=
- how does gain translate distance to pos ??
- scale of axes in terms of cov ??
- maybe plot the covariance matrix
- think about 3d plotting
- vrpn client connected to optitrack
- network asta 2020
- heat map of uncertainty
MUST:
- r**3 variance dependant on distances NOT VALID, at least for small distances
- make experiment for variance estimation and put parameters in the filter !
- how to determine process noise values ?
- document things! especially experiments, also could start writing simulation part, finish literature review part


source /ros_entrypoint.sh
source ~/asta_ws/vrpn_ws/devel/setup.bash
rostopic echo /vrpn_client_node/awww/pose


DONE:
- try multiple anchors with single tag, lib might not support that :) it does at least for two

RTT could be obtained by FTM protocol but is difficult to obtain bc hardware support is very limited. Even then requires 
quite a bit of effort to install required driver, firmware, kernel version. The distance measurement is not that precise.
Best case scenario gives 1-2m accuracy which is nice but more crude estimation would also work.

Positioning base on WiFi signal strength is way easier. Basically could be implemented with any WiFi card without spending
additional time on setup. Accuracy is worse ~10m. But meets the requirements and prob is worth trying first before going to
alternatives. Turns out that the distance to signal curve flattens out at around 20m and cannot measure distances beyond that...

tcpdump measure in nano precision :)
sudo tcpdump --time-stamp-precision=nanoseconds -tttt
sudo tcpdump -i wlp4s0 icmp -tttt --time-stamp-precision=nanoseconds --time-stamp-type=adapter_unsynced

So wifi frequency is maxa 80MHz which in time based methods alone results in max theoretical distance resolution of 3.5m of time based methods.

Measuring Round Trip Times to Determine the Distance Between WLAN Nodes
803 pdf page; data collection & processing
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/b136094.pdf
The resolution of these hardware time stamps, which are implemented in
most current WLAN products, is 1 Î¼s corresponding to 300 m. :D and they 
don't say how they get those hardware timestamps either, mistery still.

why some papers say that distance resolution is dependant on bandwidth?
even though the wifi freq is 2.4 of 5 GHz. How come the distance resolution
calculation only takes in bandwidth for example 20MHz or 40MHz???

How does UWB solve this? - that's probably the best shot pretty easy to implement

BLE RSSI - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7275525

UWB dependand on power it could go for even bigger distances, 
it's just a matter of regulatory policies but in research case
prob not that relevant. Also interference could be an issue.



go with makerfabs device & focus more on localisation part of the project
try to write text about he researched done by now. And start looking at the
simulation of KF to localise an agent.

RF-based positioning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

Goal of the project is to:
1. Investigate different RF technologies for positioning and evaluate their pros and cons, e.g. WiFi, UWB, BLE, etc.
2. Implement an RF based range measurement method
3. Compare range measurement using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) and RTT (Round Trip Time)
4. Implement a Bayesian filter for positioning using aforementioned range measurement(s)
