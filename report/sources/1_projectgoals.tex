\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate different RF technologies for positioning and evaluate their pros and cons, e.g. WiFi, UWB, BLE, etc.
    \item Implement an RF based range measurement method
    \item Compare range measurement using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) and RTT (Round Trip Time)
    \item Implement a Bayesian filter for positioning using aforementioned range measurement(s)
\end{itemize}
